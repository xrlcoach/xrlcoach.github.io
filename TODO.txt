- Configure update_stats and finalise_stats to calculate lineup score and store it in the fixtures data of the round
    e.g. 'fixtures': [{
        'home': {
            'team': 'ITC',
            'score': 48
        },
        'away': {
            'team': 'TT1',
            'score': 30
        }
    }]
    UPDATE: Just did it like this:
    'fixtures': [{
        'home': 'ITC',
        'away': 'TT1',
        'home_score': 48,
        'away_score': 25
    }]

- Configure lineup setting to allow for positional preference for interchange players who have more than one position.
 -- KIND OF DONE. Substitutions go in order of interchange listing. Program will try to sub them on in first choice, and then will try second choice.
    No 'smart' subbing which looks for way to sub in all bench players.

- Plan waiver system

- Make individual player page
